TalkMyPhone is open-source and I am obviously open to any contribution. If you want to help, make sure you read this page

## Contributing to the core code ##

  * Please use mercurial. It's easy. Set up an account on any github-like or use the "clone this repository" button and give me the address of your clone, so that I can pull your fabulous new features.
  * Be nice with the battery. See the [video](http://code.google.com/intl/de/events/io/2009/sessions/CodingLifeBatteryLife.html) google made about this stuff, or at least read the pdf.
  * Target android 1.5. I know there is good stuff in the current SDK, but I won't take patches if they don't run on my own phone (a samsung galaxy with android 1.5).

## Greasemonkey scripts ##

It would be nice if someone wrote some greasemonkey script to improve support of talkmyphone in gmail. TalkMyPhone will remain useable from any standard web browser, but it just would be usefull to add buttons on contacts in gmail to automatically insert their phone number in the TalkMyPhone chat window. If you write such a script, I'd be happy to put a link about it on the frontpage.

## Writing desktop clients ##

Writing a desktop client for TalkMyPhone shouldn't be a very complicated task. There are plenty of python xmpp libraries that can help you to integrate better the use of the phone from your desktop. I'd also be happy to link the frontpage to any project doing that.
