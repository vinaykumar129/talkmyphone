# About hardware issues #

I can't fix - thus, I won't - hardware issues, because I don't own every android devices. I just own a samsung galaxy i7500, and all I can tell is TalkMyPhone runs fine on it. I'm fine with you reporting about it (so that the other know) but I'll just ask you to confirm it is a hardware issue.

# Confirming it is an hardware issue #

It is very simple: just test your settings on another device known to work. If you don't have such a device, an emulator can do the trick: just install [the android sdk](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html), create an [android virtual device (avd)](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/avd.html) of the api level 3 (android 1.5) or above , launch it, install the application on it (browse to the site - don't forget to enable third party apps) and test it with the exact same settings. If it does not work, then blame your settings. Otherwise, blame your hardware.
